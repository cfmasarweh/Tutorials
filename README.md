#### Goal for this document: I created this as an easy-to-read and reproducable documentation and short explanation of how I used ColabFold to model each unique protein sequence in Vital et al.’s (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00130-17) butyrate synthesis pathway enzymes database. To save time, I didn’t try very hard to explain the code, so please let me know if something is broken, stupid, or confusing.
